## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Documentation: 
EH_ID: the unique identifier of the mouse
experiment: the experiment as numbered in the overview table
mouse_strain: the strain (inbred or outbred) of the mouse
primary_infection: The Eimeria strain used for the primary infection
challenge_infection: The Eimeria strain used for the challenge infection
infection_history: The resulting infection history
labels: the unique label of the fecal sample at a particular dpi
weight: the weight of the mouse at this dpi
weight_dpi0: the weight at the day of infection
relative_weight: the weight of the mouse at this dpi relative to the weight at dpi0
feces_weight: the weight of the feces collected at this dpi
dpi: days post infection at which samples and data in this row were taken
infection: the infection (primary or challenge) this row/dpi corresponds to
oocyst_sq1, oocyst_sq2, oocyst_sq3, oocyst_sq4: the raw values for squared during oocyst counting
dilution: the amount of PBS the feces (with it's relative weight) was dissolved in
OO4sq: the sum of oocysts in the four counting squares
OOC: the overall number of oocysts in in the feces (of a particular weight) at this dpi
OPG_O: Old way of counting opg (Emanuel ask me)


## Please include the following columns in your csv files: 
oocyst.cols.wild = column names if you are using wild mice data
oocyst.cols.lab = column names if you are using lab mice data
```{r}
oocyst.cols.wild     <- c("Mouse_ID", "Year", "counter", "Feces_Weight", 
                          "Date_count", "N_oocysts_sq1", "N_oocysts_sq2",
                          "N_oocysts_sq3",  "N_oocysts_sq4","N_oocysts_sq5",
                          "N_oocysts_sq6", "N_oocysts_sq7","N_oocysts_sq8",
                          "mean_neubauer", "PBS_dil_in_mL", "OPG",
                          "Ncells")

oocyst.cols.lab <- c("EH_ID", "experiment", "labels", "feces_weight", 
                     "dpi", "oocyst_sq1", "oocyst_sq2", "oocyst_sq3",
                     "oocyst_sq4","oocyst_sq5", "oocyst_sq6", "oocyst_sq7",
                     "oocyst_sq8", "dilution", "OO8sq", "OPG")
