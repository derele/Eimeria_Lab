# How to rmarkdown for our lab protocols


This is some documentation on what the directory Lab_procols includes and on how to produce or edit our Lab_protocols using Rmarkdown.


Rmarkdown produces reproducible lab protocols. 

To make or edit a lab protocol open or create a file with the .rmd extension. 

If you want to create a markdown document open Rstudio and click on new file --> R Markdown. 

Here is a cheat sheet on how to format the file: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf


After editing the rmarkdown document, press the knit button to get an output file 
of the protocol. Please keep only the rmarkdown file on GitHub.
